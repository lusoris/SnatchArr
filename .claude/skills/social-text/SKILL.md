# Social register for the forge (`social-text`)

Adapted from [i-have-adhd](https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd) by Ayoub Ghriss and [contributors](https://github.com/ayghri/i-have-adhd/graphs/contributors) via adhd-format; MIT licence.

Use this skill for forge text a person reads: issue, pull-request body, review comment, commit body, changelog fragment title. = `social` register of text-register policy (`register:` in `.standards.yaml`; "Text Register" section of AGENTS.md). Agent-to-agent text -> `internal` register, documentation -> `docs` register; neither uses this skill.

## Inherited from adhd-format

Skill inherits 3 `adhd-format` principles by reference; not restated here:

1. **Bottom line first**: first sentence = decision, defect or ask.
2. **Scannable structure**: paragraphs <=3 sentences; bold operative words of action bullet.
3. **Progressive disclosure**: summary first, commands second, detail linked or collapsed below.

Overrides rest of adhd-format for humans: at most 1 GitHub alert per text; no Mermaid unless flow is point of change; tables only for 3+ rows; no emoji headings; no anchor bolding in running prose.

## Voice

- Full sentences, plain words. Maintainer must act on text without opening diff.
- One idea per paragraph or bullet. Name file and line (`.agents/skills/caveman/SKILL.md:42`) when reader will look there.
- Say 4 things, then stop: what changed, why, how verified, what reviewer must decide. Pull-request summary stays around 250 words before evidence links.
- No meta-commentary (`as requested`, `based on my analysis`), no hedging filler, no code restatement diff already shows.
- Quote operator paraphrased in neutral English; never verbatim colloquial line.
- No tool attribution anywhere: no `Co-Authored-By` naming model or tool, no `generated with` footer (AGENTS.md rule 12). Strip such footer when editing existing body.

## Evidence

Link or attach evidence; never paste beyond inline bound (`register.evidence`, default 58 lines / 1500 tokens). Test log, SARIF file or transcript -> `evidence: <path> sha256:<12 hex> lines:<n>`, or attached file. Signed receipt = one exception, pasted where template asks for it.

## Standards this register does not change

**Pull-request body.** Fill the pull request template exactly as shipped. Social register governs only prose under `## Summary of Changes`. Sections 1-4 (HISS-16 checklist, 3D-testing verification, context-integrity checklist, receipt) = filled, never rewritten, reordered or removed. Receipt goes inside fence labelled `receipt`; unlabelled fence not read by validator.

**Commit message.** Subject stays conventional commit, `type(scope): subject`, `type` one of `feat | fix | docs | style | refactor | perf | test | build | ci | chore | revert`. Commit-msg hook rejects other shape, requires `Signed-off-by` trailer. Keep subject near 72 characters; hook does not measure it, reader's terminal does. Breaking change carries `!` in subject, `Migration:` footer (HISS-14). Only body written in this register: why first, then what, wrapped at 72 columns.

**Changelog.** Never edit `CHANGELOG.md` directly. Write one fragment `<date>-<slug>.yaml` in the changelog fragment directory with `type` from `added | changed | deprecated | removed | fixed | security`, one-sentence imperative `title`, optional `issue`, `breaking: true` when applicable. Register shapes title only.

**Issue.** Title = defect in one sentence. Body: observed, expected, reproduction commands, evidence pointers. Search open issues, pull requests before filing (AGENTS.md rule 5).

**Review comment.** One finding per comment; severity word first, then file:line, then fix. Address code, not author.
