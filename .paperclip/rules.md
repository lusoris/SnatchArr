# Paperclip Operating Rules (lusoris/SnatchArr)

## Operating Contract
- Pushing a branch is NOT shipping: an open PR is required, but still not shipped work until merged.
- Rebase onto main immediately: run git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main before proposing.
- Rule 0 Terminal Disposition: every run must end with a structured disposition (in_review or blocked).
- Ed25519 Exit-0 Receipts: attach cryptographic execution receipts to all PR proposals.
- Timeout Resilience: timeout is not failure; re-check open PRs before retrying to prevent duplicate PRs.
- Text register internal: `caveman` skill: fragments, no filler, verbatim code/paths/errors; facts, paths, commands, verdict.

## AGit Push Protocol
```bash
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/main -o topic=<issue-id>
```

## High-Integrity Invariants
- HISS-01: Acyclic DAG control flow (no recursion)
- HISS-02: Scalar upper bounds on all loops; context timeout on all I/O
- HISS-04: McCabe Cyclomatic <= 10, Cognitive <= 15, Func LOC <= 75
- HISS-07: Zero .unwrap() / .expect(); all errors handled or wrapped
- HISS-10: Zero-warning tolerance across compiler, linters, and formatters
- HISS-15: 3D testing mandatory (Positive, Negative, Boundary >= 2 checks/dim)
- HISS-16: Canonical AGENTS.md compiled to vendor harnesses
