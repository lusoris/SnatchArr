# The one place the hook policy starts its Python 3 interpreter (#339). Every job
# in praetor.yml and the pre-push script start their hook through this file, and
# a hook that starts another Python process reuses the interpreter it is running
# under (sys.executable), so no command spells an interpreter of its own.
#
# No variable selects the program: a value naming anything that exits 0 would
# pass every gate without running it. The candidates are a fixed list, tried in
# order, the same one the operator setting hooks.python defaults to
# (internal/config/operator_sections.go) and scripts/toolchain.py declares.
#
# A candidate is trusted only once it has proven itself: it runs the probe and
# must state Python 3 at or above the floor. A name on PATH proves nothing.
# Windows puts python.exe and python3.exe there as Microsoft Store aliases,
# which start, print "Python was not found" and exit nonzero. The first proven
# candidate replaces this shell, so its status is the hook's. With none left
# the hook fails as a missing dependency and names what was tried.
#
# Every line below ends in a comment sign, blank ones included. praetorctl adopt
# writes this file into repositories whose checkout may give it CRLF line
# endings (core.autocrlf), and a shell reads the carriage return as part of the
# last word of a line. Behind a comment sign it is part of the comment.
